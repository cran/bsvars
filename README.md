Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive Models

This package provides efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of
Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models via Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods. A wide range of SVAR models is considered, including
homo- and heteroskedastic specifications and those with non-normal
structural shocks.
